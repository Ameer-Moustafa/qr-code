# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

First challenge for frontendmentor.io, I needed more HTML, CSS and responsive design practice while continuing to learn JS. This website was a great place to do it!

Second attempt - **August 20/2023**:

Re-doing every Frontend mentor challenge I've done so far, Just for practice. This was definitely much easier than it was the first time. Efficiency has definitely increased by a massive margin and I didn't run into any of the problems I ran into on my first attempt with this challenge. Overall the progress is very visible.

## My process:

- Desktop first Workflow
- Responsive Design
- Flexbox

## What I learned:

My process remained the same but I learned a ton between the first and second time attempting this challenge.

- Setting a height ruined responsiveness and was unecessary, allowed me to write less media queries.
- Using CSS variables for colors will make large projects easier to maintain.
- Generally got better at writing cleaner CSS and eliminating redundancy.
